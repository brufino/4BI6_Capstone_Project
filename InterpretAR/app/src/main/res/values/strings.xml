    <string name="brandon_about_me">I am an electrical and biomedical engineering student who is passionate about advancing the health care field through applying engineering principles. Most of my work today is done burying my head in books or working on my final year capstone project as I approach graduation (April 2019). \n \n I strive under pressure (how else are diamond made?) and am always looking for the next opportunity to develop my skills with goals to one day pursue an academic, R&amp;D, or entrepreneurial career!</string>
